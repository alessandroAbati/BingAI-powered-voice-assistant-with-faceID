# AI-Powered Voice Assistant

This repository contains code for an AI-powered voice assistant that can interact with users, provide information, and assist with tasks. The project is based on the excellent work of the [Bing-GPT-Voice-Assistant](https://github.com/Ai-Austin/Bing-GPT-Voice-Assistant) repository by [Ai-Austin](https://github.com/Ai-Austin), which served as the foundation for this project. It has been extended to include additional features and capabilities.

## Features

- **Wake Words**: The voice assistant responds to the wake words "ok bing" or "ok chat.", the former will send the prompt to Bing AI, while the latter will send it to Chat GPT 3.5

- **Chat Interaction**: With the wake word recognized, users can engage in a conversation with the voice assistant.

- **Speech Synthesis**: Responses from the voice assistant are synthesized using Amazon Polly, providing a natural and human-like voice (which can be customized on the AWS webiste).

## Requirements

To use this voice assistant, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You must have an OpenAI API key to enable the GPT-3 chat capabilities. Get your API key by visiting the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

2. **AWS Account and Polly Access**: The voice synthesis feature is powered by Amazon Polly. You need an AWS account and API credentials for Polly to use this feature.

## Getting Started

### Using Conda (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alessandroAbati/AI-powered-voice-assistant.git
   cd AI-powered-voice-assistant

2. Set up virtual environment with Conda using the provided environment.yml file:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate voice-assistant-env

3. Replace [paste your OpenAI API key here] in main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.
   Alternatively, one can use a config.yml file that will be ignored by git while pushing.
   
4. Run the voice assistant:
   ```bash
   python main.py

### Using Pip

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alessandroAbati/AI-powered-voice-assistant.git
   cd AI-powered-voice-assistant

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)::

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages using pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Replace [paste your OpenAI API key here] in main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.
   
5. Run the voice assistant:
   ```bash
   python main.py

### Usage

1. Start the voice assistant by running main.py.
2. Use the wake word ("ok bing" or "ok chat") to start the assistant based on the AI you want to use.   
3. Speak your prompt.
4. The voice assistant will respond based on the prompt using either GPT-3 or Bing AI.
5. Enjoy the interactions with your AI-powered voice assistant!

### Important Note
This voice assistant uses AI technologies and requires proper API keys. It's essential to keep your API keys and credentials secure and follow the usage guidelines of the respective services.

## Next Steps/ Future Improvements
Here are some potential areas for enhancement and development:

- **Additional AI**: Integrate other AI like BARD for more choice.

- **Handle long conversation**: Implement features to handle long conversation with the AI using more than one prompt.

- **Additional APIs**: Integrate other APIs for more functionalities, such as weather information, news updates, or language translation.

- **Automatically select AI**: Automatically select the best AI for the submitted prompt.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors or unexpected user input.

- **Optimization**: Optimize the code for efficiency and performance, especially when interacting with external APIs.

- **Continuous Learning**: Explore methods to make the voice assistant learn from user interactions and improve over time.

- **Community Contributions**: Encourage others to contribute to the project by adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.

- **User Interface**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the voice assistant more user-friendly.

Feel free to contribute to this project by addressing any of the above points or by suggesting your own ideas!
